Okay, [the author isn't interested](https://github.com/stevemao/You-Dont-Know-Lodash-Underscore/issues/4#issuecomment-231574602) and the relevant tooling seems to be in flux. 

----

In response to [the response](https://github.com/stevemao/You-Dont-Know-Lodash-Underscore): no

I respectfully disagree with all of these rebuttals as presented.  Sorry `:(`

## _.map

> Native doesn't support the `_.property` iteratee shorthand.

It doesn't need to.  

```javascript
const arr = users.map(u => u.user);
```


### Performance

Lodash|Underscore|Steve Mao Native|Good native
--- | --- | --- | ---
972,874|101,878|102,864 (**89% slower**)|


Clearer and faster than the underscore approach, with no need for library knowledge or weight, and the bonus of being standards defined and validated by the browser vendors' test sets.

Your code:

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney' },
    { 'user': 'fred' }
  ];
  var arr = _.map(users, 'user');
  console.log(arr);
  // output: ['barney', 'fred']

  // Native
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney' },
    { 'user': 'fred' }
  ];
  var arr = users.map('user');
  // error!
  ```

## _.some

> Native doesn't support the `_.matches` iteratee shorthand.

Doesn't need it.

```javascript
peeps.some(p => p.user === 'barney' && p.active === true);
```

Native, faster, more easily optimized, better defined.

Your code:

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney', 'active': true },
    { 'user': 'fred',   'active': false }
  ];
  
  // using the `_.matches` iteratee shorthand
  _.some(users, { 'user': 'barney', 'active': false });
  // output: false

  // Native
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney', 'active': true },
    { 'user': 'fred',   'active': false }
  ];
  var result = array.some({ 'user': 'barney', 'active': false }); // error!
  ```


## _.reduce

> (no comment made by rebuttal document; js is ~12% faster)

I would point out that JS `.reduce` is more strictly defined than `_.reduce`.

## _.reduceRight

> Todo

Should be the same thing

## _.filter

> Native doesn't support the `_.matches` iteratee shorthand.

Doesn't need to.

```javascript
users.filter(u => u.age === 36 && u.active === 'true');
```

Because this can logical shortcut on age, which should have very low cardinality, in most cases the string comparison will never come to pass; there will also be no attempt to object identity match, and this relies on more easily optimized built-ins.  

Almost certainly faster, much better defined, and easy to read for anyone who knows the language, whether or not they know a utility library.

Your code:

  ```js
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36, 'active': true },
    { 'user': 'fred',   'age': 40, 'active': false }
  ];
  // using the `_.matches` iteratee shorthand
  _.filter(users, { 'age': 36, 'active': true });
  // output: objects for ['barney']

  // Native
  var users = [
    { 'user': 'barney', 'age': 36, 'active': true },
    { 'user': 'fred',   'age': 40, 'active': false }
  ];
  var filtered = users.filter({ 'age': 36, 'active': true }); // error!
  ```

## _.isNaN

> Native coerces the argument to a `Number`.

That's because you're using `isNaN/1` instead of [`Number.isNaN/1`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN).

Granted, that doesn't exist in IE.  ðŸ˜ 

However, it's easier to write this one's self, or to shim it, than to adopt underscore.

```javascript
if (Number.isNaN === undefined) { Number.isNaN = n => (typeof n === 'number') && isNaN(n) }
```

It's worth noting that as the language progresses, `Number.isNaN/1` will always have correct behavior for the types available for an individual browser, which is not the case for a library with a local install that may fall out of date.  As JavaScript progresses into having native type support (such as u32/s32 for asm.js,) this seems like an unimportant niche correctness concern.

More importantly, the builtins will be more robust, better tested, and much faster.

Your code:

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  console.log(_.isNaN("blabla"));
  // output: false

  // Native [ed: this is not actually javascript, but rather inherited gross jscript]
  // Confusing special-case behavior
  console.log(isNaN("blabla"));
  // output: true
  // surprise!
  
  // ES6
  console.log(Number.isNaN("blabla"));
  // output: false
  // but browser support maybe the problem
  ```

## _.each

So this one's a little complicated.

There are two reasons I can think of to want to exit iteration early: because you're trying to get work done on the front of the container and halt, or because halfway through you realize the work is garbage, and want to bail.

You can do both of those with underscore's `each`, but I would argue that those are both abuses.

The first - applying to the arbitrary front half of an array - would honestly be better represented as a `do while` loop.  The behavior isn't functional: it's not an application of a functor by a traversal to a container.  It's a functor modifying the traversal.  This appears to be what your code is attempting to do.

The easy vanilla notation separates the decision to continue from the mapping behavior.  This, to me, seems strictly superior.  The underscore notation forces the decision to be made together with the application, which reduces composability.

Admittedly, it is annoying to manually bound the traversal.  However, to me this seems less annoying than adding an entire library and learning its idioms.

```javascript
const droppable_each = (container, action, should_continue = () => true) => {
    let i = 0, iC = container.length;
    do (action(container[i])) while ((should_continue[i++]) && (i < iC));
}

droppable_each([1,2,3], (i) => console.log(i), () => false);
```

Because your code immediately bails, the decision to continue is just `() => false`.

Your code:

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  _.each([1, 2, 3], function(value, index) {
    console.log(value);
    return false;
  });
  // output: 1

  // Native
  [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(value, index) {
    console.log(value);
    return false; // does not exit the iteration!
  });
  // output: 1 2 3
  ```

Notably, the underscore version always returns `undefined`.  There's a good argument that that's the right thing to do, since that's what Javascript does.  However, I don't like that Javascript does that; I've always felt that JS should do what most functional languages do, and return a container of the return values from the item invocations.

So I would write it this way:

```javascript
const retaining_each = (container, action, should_continue = () => true) => {
    let i = 0, iC = container.length, result = [];
    do (result.push(action(container[i]))) while ((should_continue[i++]) && (i < iC));
    return result;
}
```

Now, there's the other possible reason to want bail-early: if you suddenly realize the whole thing is for naught.  That doesn't appear to be what your code is doing, but that's what I usually see people use iteration bail for in other languages.

In JS, that's just `.every/1`.

```javascript
[1,2,3].every(i => { console.log(i); return false; });
```

Your code, repeated:

  ```js
  // Underscore/Lodash
  _.each([1, 2, 3], function(value, index) {
    console.log(value);
    return false;
  });
  // output: 1

  // Native
  [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(value, index) {
    console.log(value);
    return false; // does not exit the iteration!
  });
  // output: 1 2 3
  ```

> Underscore/Lodash may exit iteration early by explicitly returning `false`.

This is a disadvantage, for `each`, and this is not a problem for the appropriate approaches, the `do while` loop or `.every/1` respectively.  You can bail on manual loops if you want to be able to bail, and put that behind a function if you need it more than once.  

Part of the value of `.each/1` and `.map/1` and so on is to assure the programmer that the predicate passed to the iteration cannot do this even in incorrect behavior.

Much of the purpose of the functional calls (`.map`, `.reduce`, `.filter`, and so on) is in distinguishing the behavior of the application of a functor from the quality of the functor.  You should be able to have a function that identifies whether a thing is a duck, and then filter on duck-as-a-quality.

There are important, subtle advantages to this.  For example, `.map` is inherently parallelizable - though underscore's abortable version is not.  In Mozilla Servo, which is written in a lightweight process oriented language, this is a significant performance lose.  Given the nature of parallelism, and that Microsoft Edge is moving in the same direction, and that this is becoming a common language thing (used to be esoteric to languages like erlang and mozart-oz and gambit scheme; now common in things like c# and google go.)

I believe that this will be the norm relatively soon.

Comparison performance as provided is nonsensical, since the two functions being compared aren't doing the same work.  One only applies the functor to the first item; the other to all.
